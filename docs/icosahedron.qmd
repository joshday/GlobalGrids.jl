# Icosahedron utilities

The package includes helper utilities for working with an icosahedron and its dual, useful for designing and visualizing discrete global grids.

## Building an icosahedron

```julia
using GlobalGrids, GeometryBasics

# Place a vertex direction and azimuth, return a Mesh of triangles on the unit sphere
ico = icosahedron(Point3f(0,0,1), 0.0)   # default orientation

# Preset orientations aligned with DGG literature
ico_poles     = icosahedron(:poles)
ico_isea      = icosahedron(:isea)
ico_dymaxion  = icosahedron(:dymaxion)
```

- Vertices are normalized to lie on the unit sphere.
- The function returns a `GeometryBasics.Mesh` with `TriangleFace` connectivity.

## Dual (pentagons)

Create the dual mesh: vertices at face centroids of the icosahedron and pentagonal faces around original vertices.

```julia
using GeometryBasics
ico = icosahedron(:isea)
d = GlobalGrids.dual(ico)        # Mesh with NgonFace{5}
```

## Helpers

- `rotation_matrix(axis::SVector{3}, angle)` — 3×3 Rodrigues rotation matrix
- `counterclockwise!(points)` — enforce CCW ordering of polygon vertices in their local plane
- `unit_icosahedron(T)` — base icosahedron mesh of type `T`

These helpers are generally internal, but can be useful for custom grid experiments.
