# GlobalGrids.jl

**Discrete global grids (DGGs) for Julia.**

GlobalGrids provides:

- An idiomatic Julia interface to Uber's [H3](https://h3geo.org) hexagonal grid system.
- Lightweight types for coordinates (wrappers of a `GeometryBasics.Point`) and projections: `LonLat`, `LonLatAuthalic`, `ISEA`, `ISEACube`, `ECEF`
- High‑level operations on coordinates: `haversine`, `destination`, `azimuth`, `coords2extent`
- Icosahedron mesh and orientation utilities for DGG design (a work in progress).
- Makie plotting support.

## Installation

```
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url = "https://github.com/joshday/GlobalGrids.jl")
```

## Quickstart

```{julia}
import GlobalGrids as GG
using GLMakie

# Create a lon/lat point and convert to an H3 cell at resolution 7
p = GG.LonLat(-75.0, 54.0)

c = GG.H3Cell(p, 7)
```

```{julia}
neighbors = GG.grid_ring(c, 1)
```

```{julia}
poly(neighbors, color=1:6)
```

## Conventions

In GlobalGrids:

- Angles are in degrees.
- Distances are in meters (area in meters ^ 2, etc.).
